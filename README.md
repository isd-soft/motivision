## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment notes from below on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Steps to Setup the Server

Deployment can be done on Windows/Linux/Mac OS with these components installed:

* [JDK 8 and above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [PostgreSQL 10](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## DataBase
To setup the database you first need to install a Postgresql server [link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). After you've installed it add the bin folder to your  Path system variable.Then access command prompt and change your directory to the folder with the db dump.

 ```
 >cd <path_to_dump>
 ```
          
After you have completed the installation you can login as a postgtres user like so

 ```
 psql postgres -U postgres
 ```
 
If you have already "motivision" database then run:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS motivision;
```

Now you can create the database by running the following command

 ```
 CREATE DATABASE motivision;
 ```    
          
After that try running this command

 ```
 >psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres motivision
 ```

And restore the database with 

 ```
 motivision=# \i cleanDump.sql
 ```
 
 If you want to run server as a .jar file from terminal just write:
 ```
 cd /motivision/api/
 
 Linux/Mac OS:
  sh mvnw.sh
 
 Windows:
  mvnw.cmd
 ```


To run it as a .war read following:

# Steps to Setup the Client

Deployment can be done on Windows/Linux/Mac OS with these components installed:

* [JDK 8 and above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Android Studio with SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

## Android

You can build apk in Android Studio following instruction:

![Build your own apk](readme/build_apk.png?raw=true "Don't click me")

```
Apk will be saved in following directory:
/motivision/client/android/build/outputs/apk/[your_apk]
```
## Desktop

To build jar in Android Studio just press on Gradle menu from the right corner and then double click on "dist" gradle task:

![Build you own jar](readme/build_jar1.png?raw=true "Don't click me")
